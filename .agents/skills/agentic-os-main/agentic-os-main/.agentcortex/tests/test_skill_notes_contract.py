## Skill Notes

### test-driven-development
- First Loaded Phase: implement
- Applies To: implement, test

#### implement
- Checklist: Write the failing test before changing production code.
- Checklist: Keep the implementation minimal until the target assertion passes.
- Constraint: Do not batch multiple behaviors into one Red to Green cycle because review needs step-level evidence.

#### test
- Checklist: Confirm every production change has a corresponding test before completion.
- Checklist: Re-run the focused suite after adding any missing regression coverage.
- Constraint: Test completion is invalid if critical paths still rely on narrative confidence instead of passing output.

### verification-before-completion
- First Loaded Phase: implement
- Applies To: implement, test, ship

#### implement
- Checklist: Verify scope against the approved target files before claiming completion.
- Checklist: Capture the command and result immediately after each implementation step.
- Constraint: Never claim implementation complete without reproducible terminal evidence tied to this turn.

#### ship
- Checklist: Re-run required checks after syncing with mainline.
- Checklist: Confirm rollback strategy and known risks are present in the completion summary.
- Constraint: Shipping is blocked when any verification gate is unresolved or evidence is stale.

### red-team-adversarial
- First Loaded Phase: review
- Applies To: review, test

#### review
- Checklist: Enumerate boundary abuse cases before declaring the review ready.
- Checklist: Record any high-risk finding with an explicit accept or fix decision.
- Constraint: Red-team output cannot be reduced to a generic security note because the phase needs attack-specific evidence.

#### test
- Checklist: Turn realistic abuse paths into executable adversarial checks when possible.
- Checklist: Record which scenarios were skipped and why if environment limits execution.
- Constraint: Test evidence must distinguish standard regressions from adversarial stress cases.

## Evidence
Command: python -m pytest .agentcortex/tests -q
Result: pass
Summary: fixture evidence

## Resume
- State: REVIEWED
- Completed: implement, review
- Next: run ship gate
- Context: keep protected sections intact during compaction.

## Delta Log
- very long historical entry 1
