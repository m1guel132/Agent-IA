## Drift Log
- Skip Attempt: NO
- Gate Fail Reason: N/A
- Token Leak: NO
- Process note: first implementation commit used PowerShell here-string syntax (`@'...'@`) inside the Bash tool, which bash does NOT parse as a here-string → a literal `@` line polluted the commit title. Fixed via `git commit --amend -F <clean-msg-file>` (commit f3ac21c). Lesson: in the Bash tool use bash heredoc or `-F file`, never PowerShell `@'...'@`.
- SSoT writes (implement + ship) routed through guard_context_write.py replace mode with expected-sha optimistic lock, per bootstrap §1 / AGENTS.md Write Isolation.

## Task Description
- Fix 3 verified SSoT drifts in `.agentcortex/context/current_state.md`:
  1. ADR Index (L22-23): ADR-004 / ADR-005 labelled `proposed 2026-06-03` but both ADR files are `status: accepted` and the implementing spec is `[Shipped 2026-06-03]` (PR #175). → flip to `accepted`.
  2. Active Backlog (L24): `(40 items; ...)` stale — actual active backlog = 23 rows (post 2026-06-02 archive split, backlog #8 moved 33 rows to cold storage). → correct count.
  3. Spec Index header (L25): convention is shipped-only graduation (every entry `[Shipped]`; drafts/research tracked in backlog Spec File column), but undocumented → add one-line note so unindexed drafts (tiered-doc-lifecycle, skill-research-integration, _research-rpi-qrspi-corroboration) don't read as drift.
- Also refresh `Last Verified` → 2026-06-09 (bootstrap §1).
- Phase chain: /plan → /implement → /review → /test → /ship
- EXCLUDED from scope (follow-up): archiving backlog rows #50/#56 (Shipped, still in active backlog) — touching `_product-backlog.md` routes to /spec-intake per bootstrap §0; kept separate.

## Phase Sequence
- bootstrap
- plan

## External References
- docs/adr/ADR-004-override-layer-activation.md (status: accepted)
- docs/adr/ADR-005-downstream-file-preservation-tiering.md (status: accepted)
- docs/specs/_product-backlog.md (23 active rows) + _product-backlog-archive.md (33 rows)

## Known Risk
- SSoT write must go through `.agentcortex/tools/guard_context_write.py` (bootstrap §1 / AGENTS.md Write Isolation). Non-ship SSoT metadata-repair write is permitted by bootstrap §1 ("repair or refresh SSoT metadata ... MUST go through guard"); log here.
- Drift 3 is a judgment call (shipped-only convention). Confirmed via: every Spec Index entry is [Shipped]; backlog #11 "Shipped specs accumulation — status-driven filtering" proves the team treats index as shipped-accumulation; drafts ARE tracked in backlog. Note-only, no data added/removed.

## Risks
- SSoT is governance-critical: edits are header-field metadata only (no rule/section semantics). Rollback = `git checkout main -- .agentcortex/context/current_state.md` or revert branch.
- guard_context_write.py may be section-append-oriented, not header-field-edit capable. Mitigation: inspect tool interface at /implement; if unsupported for inline header edits, use AGENTS.md Write Isolation fallback (direct Edit + Drift Log note). Python IS available (3.14).
- Drift 3 note is a judgment call; worded as descriptive convention, adds/removes no index data.

## Conflict Resolution
none

## Skill Notes
none

## Phase Summary
- bootstrap: classified as quick-win (SSoT metadata correction, governance doc, no semantic rule change); skill verification-before-completion matched; SSoT + guardrails-quick + state_machine loaded.
- plan: 1 target file (current_state.md), 5 inline header-field edits + seq bump at ship, Fast Lane; rollback = revert branch. | Confidence: 96% — high
- implement: applied 5 SSoT header edits via guard_context_write.py replace (expected-sha c470a749→d7a2cd1e); git diff = 5 ins/5 del on current_state.md only; validate.sh fail=0; no scope divergence. | Confidence: 97% — high
- ship: verdict PASS; SSoT seq 43→44 + Last Updated + ship-history entry via guard replace (d7a2cd1e→2e1ba4a4); commit f3ac21c (impl) + ship commit; archived to archive/ + INDEX.jsonl chain entry.

## Gate Evidence
- Gate: bootstrap | Verdict: PASS | Classification: quick-win | Timestamp: 2026-06-09

## Evidence
- Diff: `git diff` = 5 insertions / 5 deletions on `.agentcortex/context/current_state.md` only (+ tracked guard receipts `.guard_receipt.json`, `.guard_receipts/337ffd90d88a8b4f.json`).
- Before/after (grep-verified):
  - L16 Last Verified 2026-06-08 → 2026-06-09
  - L22 ADR-004 `proposed 2026-06-03` → `accepted 2026-06-03` (matches ADR-004 frontmatter `status: accepted`)
  - L23 ADR-005 `proposed 2026-06-03` → `accepted 2026-06-03` (matches ADR-005 frontmatter `status: accepted`)
  - L24 Active Backlog `40 items` → `23 active items` (+ archive-split note; actual active rows = 23, archive = 33)
  - L25 Spec Index header → notes shipped-only graduation convention
- Integrity: `bash validate.sh` → pass=99 warn=9 fail=0 skip=2. fail=0. warn delta vs v1.4.1 baseline (7→9) = my own in-flight work log ("active work log count 9>8") + a pre-existing stale-lock fluctuation; none touch current_state.md.
- SSoT write routed through guard_context_write.py (optimistic lock, expected-sha verified). Receipt: `.guard_receipts/337ffd90d88a8b4f.json`.

## Post-Ship Addendum (work continued in same PR #208)
This log was archived at the ship snapshot; the bullets above are accurate as of that moment. The work unit then continued at user request — superseding state:
- **Active Backlog count**: the "23 active items / archive-split note" above was later (a) trimmed of the over-annotation, and (b) superseded by archiving the 2 remaining Shipped rows (#50, #56) to `_product-backlog-archive.md` → active is now **21 all-Pending rows**; SSoT count synced 40→21. The "#50/#56 deferred" note above is therefore obsolete — they were archived in this PR.
- **Extension fix (post-ship multi-angle review)**: activated a dormant guard — both `validate.sh`/`validate.ps1` and `ship.md` expect the Active Backlog path backtick-quoted, but the SSoT used a bare path so the path-consistency check was vacuously passing; backtick-quoting re-activated it (no new validator added).
- **Process catch**: archiving #50/#56 with a leading-`\n` Edit anchor on a CRLF file merged rows #48/#51/#57 onto one line; caught by a row-count check (19 vs expected 21) and repaired before commit (final diff clean). See memory `feedback-edit-row-delete-verify-count`.
- **Final integrity**: `bash validate.sh` → pass=101 warn=7 fail=0 skip=2 (v1.4.1 baseline). Commits `f3ac21c` → `400333b` (6 total). PR #208 CI green.
