## Task Description

Backlog **#88**: the three Windows pytest shards are badly unbalanced because `--splits 3 --group N` runs with no committed `.test_durations`, so pytest-split falls back to an even **count** split and clusters the subprocess-shelling deploy tests onto one shard. Commit a durations file so the split balances by time.

**#88's recorded measurement (`7:14`) is stale by ~3×** — corrected here from the #417 CI run.

## Phase Summary

**bootstrap** — `quick-win`. Adds `.test_durations` (generated, not hand-written) and corrects two comments that assert the file does not exist. No test or source behaviour changes.

**plan** — Keep CI's default `duration_based_chunks`. `least_duration` was measured and is exactly ideal (19.1/19.1/19.1 vs 19.6/19.5/18.2), but it reorders tests across groups; 2.6% is not worth that risk. Measured decision, not preference. Confidence: 93% — high.

**implement** — Committed a 897-entry `.test_durations` (generated, not authored) and corrected two comments that asserted the file did not exist (`validate.yml:332`, `requirements-ci.txt:8`). No workflow flags changed — CI already passes `--splits/--group` and pytest-split picks up the default path. Confidence: 95% — high.

**ship** — SSoT 158→159, Ship History rotated (10/10 held). Backlog #88 → **Shipped** with its stale `7:14` figure corrected to the real `21m57s / 3m19s / 4m14s`. D-1: none recorded (no design fork survived to ship).

## Known Risk

- **The durations file is machine-relative**: generated on this Windows box (57.3 min total) rather than on `windows-latest` (~29.5 min total). pytest-split only needs **relative** weights and the dominant cost (subprocess spawn) is the same class, but absolute times differ ~1.9× and this must be stated in the PR, not implied away.
- **A durations file goes stale** as tests are added: pytest-split falls back to count-splitting for unknown test ids, so drift degrades gracefully rather than breaking. No guard exists to detect staleness — do not claim one.
- **Do NOT re-propose two closed paths**: `pytest-xdist` was measured slower here (`validate.yml:305-309`); deselecting `slow` in CI is explicitly rejected in `pytest.ini` (subprocess fidelity is the point of those tests).
- **Non-required contexts**: `Pytest (Windows)` is not a required check, so this improves wall-clock and feedback latency — it does not change what can block a merge.

## Decisions

none

---

## Conflict Resolution

Reused from this session's earlier units: `karpathy-principles` vs `verification-before-completion` = compatible.

---

## Skill Notes

- `verification-before-completion` — cached: Scope → Quality → Evidence → Risk → Communication; the quoted run must postdate the last state write.

---

## Drift Log

- Skip Attempt: NO
- Gate Fail Reason: N/A
- Token Leak: NO
- Backlog write at bootstrap (#88 → In Progress): **the first such advance permitted by the AGENTS.md line #178 shipped hours earlier** — previously this step contradicted §Write Isolation.

## Evidence

- Branch from `818007e` (main, post-#178 merge); tree clean. Lock: `created / missing`.
- Durations generated on this box: `pytest ... --store-durations` → **896 passed, 1 skipped, exit 0** in 57:20; **897 entries, 57.3 min total**.

### Predicted balance — CI's exact invocation, default algorithm

| shard | before (#417 real CI) | after (predicted, this box) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **21m57s** | 19.6 min (210 tests) |
| 2 | 3m19s | 19.5 min (47 tests) |
| 3 | 4m14s | 18.2 min (640 tests) |
| worst shard as % of total work | **74%** | **34%** (ideal 33.3%) |

Scaled by the 1.94× box↔runner factor the prediction was ≈ **10.1 min**.

### MEASURED on PR #419 — the prediction was optimistic

| shard | before (#417) | predicted | **actual (#419)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 21m57s | 19.6 min | **7m18s** |
| 2 | 3m19s | 19.5 min | **8m28s** |
| 3 | 4m14s | 18.2 min | **13m7s** |
| worst | **21m57s** | — | **13m7s** |
| worst share of total | 74% | 34% | **45%** (ideal 33.3%) |

Real improvement **1.67× (first run)** and **1.93× (post-rebase re-run: 6m56s / 6m43s / 11m24s)** — quoted as a **range**, because two runs of the same tree differed by ~13% and picking the better number would be a claim the data does not support. Either way the predicted 2.2× was not reached. The §Known Risk caveat — durations generated on a workstation, not `windows-latest` — is **confirmed by measurement**: the runner weights many-small-tests relatively higher, so the 640-test shard became the slowest rather than the fastest. Follow-up recorded on backlog #88: regenerate durations on the runner (`workflow_dispatch` + `--store-durations` + artifact) to approach the 9.6-min ideal. Owner accepted the 1.67× now and deferred the optimisation.

`least_duration` measured at 19.1/19.1/19.1 — better, rejected for cross-group reordering risk.

### Distribution (why ~10 min is the floor)

- `test_validator_count_parity_on_framework` **479.2s** and `test_170_underscore_meta_specs_no_status_warn` **406.9s** = **25.8% of the whole suite**; the heaviest single test alone is 13.9%.
- 87 of 897 tests (9.7%) carry 90% of the runtime.
- A perfect split cannot beat the heaviest single test — attacking those two is a separate unit with fidelity risk.

### FINAL verification (postdates every implement-phase state write)

- `validate.ps1` → **exit 0** · `pass=118 warn=3 fail=0 skip=2` · unqualified pass.
- `validate.sh` → **exit 0** · `pass=118 warn=3 fail=0 skip=2` · unqualified pass. **Twin WARN sets identical this time** — the run finished inside the 60-min lock window, so no staleness delta.
- Full CI-equivalent suite, no `-m` filter → **896 passed, 1 skipped, exit 0** in 47:19.
- `test_ci_hardening.py` (reads `validate.yml`) → **13 passed**.
- Scope check: `.test_durations` is not referenced by `deploy.sh`, so it is not shipped downstream.
