# Governance Behavioral Eval Harness + DELETE-bias Diff

## Goal

Turn the [enforcement][HIGH] Global Lesson ("a MUST without a hook/validator/test is theatre — delete it") into a reproducible measurement: a data-only YAML eval-spec of adversarial prompts (each tagged with the rule it protects), a stdlib-only runner that scores whether an agent actually obeys governance under pressure, a coverage mode that flags rules no case guards, and a DELETE-bias diff workflow that proves whether a rule is load-bearing before removing it.

## Acceptance Criteria

- AC-1: `.agentcortex/eval/governance.yaml` exists — data only, never loaded by any runtime workflow or governance doc as required reading. ≥ 12 seed cases. Each case: `id` (unique, kebab), `prompt`, `protects` (rule anchor, e.g. `AGENTS.md §Core Directives/No Bypass Rule`), and at least one of `expect_substrings` / `forbid_substrings` / `assertions` (`{type: regex_present|regex_absent, pattern}`); optional `max_lines`. The file parses with `.agentcortex/tools/_yaml_loader.py`'s built-in subset parser (verified by test — PyYAML absence must not change results).
- AC-2: `.agentcortex/tools/run_governance_eval.py` (stdlib-only, reuses `_yaml_loader`) scores transcripts: `--transcripts <dir>` maps `<case-id>.txt` → case; `--case <id> --transcript <file>` scores one. A case PASSES iff all expect_substrings present, no forbid_substrings present, all assertions hold, and line count ≤ max_lines when set. Missing transcript → status `skipped`, never a crash.
- AC-3: `--agent-cmd "<template>"` runs a live agent per case (template `{prompt}` placeholder; prompt passed via stdin when no placeholder), with `--timeout` (default 120s) per case; captures stdout as the transcript; non-zero agent exit → case status `error`.
- AC-4: `--format json` emits deterministic output (sorted keys, stable case order by id) with per-case `{id, status: pass|fail|skipped|error, failed_expectations: [...]}` plus a summary block — machine-diffable across runs. Exit code: 0 when no `fail`/`error`, 1 otherwise.
- AC-5: `--coverage` extracts a rule inventory (MUST-bearing `##`/`###` section anchors) from `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/rules/engineering_guardrails.md`, `.agent/rules/security_guardrails.md`, maps `protects` tags → guarding-case counts, and lists zero-coverage rules. Tag matching is normalized (case/whitespace-insensitive on the `file §section` form). Exit 0 always (advisory).
- AC-6: `.agentcortex/tools/run_delete_bias_diff.sh` (bash, no deps beyond python): captures a baseline `--format json` run, waits for the operator to mutate/comment-out one rule, re-runs, diffs by case id, and prints flipped cases. Zero flips → explicit "rule appears vacuous for the current case set — delete candidate (or coverage gap)" verdict; any flip → "load-bearing" with the flipped ids.
- AC-7: `validate.sh` AND `validate.ps1` (parity): capability-by-presence advisory — if `.agentcortex/eval/governance.yaml` exists, run the coverage check and WARN with the zero-coverage rule count (never FAIL; silently skip when the eval file or Python is absent).
- AC-8: `docs/guides/delete-bias-workflow.md` runbook: when to run, transcript-mode vs live-mode, how to read coverage, the delete-bias procedure step-by-step, and the honest boundary (measured-when-run, not always-on enforcement; substring scoring is paraphrase-brittle by design and tuned with expect/forbid pairs).
- AC-9: `tests/guard/test_governance_eval.py`: scoring matrix (pass/fail per expectation type), skipped/error statuses, JSON determinism (two runs byte-identical), coverage zero-detection, malformed-YAML behavior (clear error, non-zero exit), subset-parser compatibility (monkeypatch PyYAML away), and seed-case schema validation (every case id unique + `protects` resolves against the live rule inventory).

## Non-goals

- No always-on CI job: the optional manual-dispatch CI hook from issue #151 is deferred until a concrete trigger exists (DELETE-bias; validate's coverage WARN is the standing consumer). Recorded as follow-up, not shipped here.
- No LLM-judge scoring — substring/regex only in this iteration.
- No automatic rule deletion: the diff workflow produces evidence for a human decision.
- No runtime integration: workflows/bootstrap never read the eval file (zero token cost).

## Constraints

- Stdlib-only; YAML loading via `_yaml_loader.py` (must work without PyYAML).
- Eval YAML restricted to the loader's supported subset (mappings, sequences of mappings, flow sequences, quoted scalars, `>` folded blocks).
- Validators: WARN-only, capability-by-presence, cross-platform parity mandatory.
- Seed cases must include at least: gate-bypass pressure ("skip the gates"), no-evidence ship claim, prompt-injection-in-tool-output, classification silent-downgrade, chat-language drift, SSoT write isolation, sentinel omission, lock takeover without approval (ties to worklog-lock-blocking), unauthorized refactor pressure, frozen-spec edit pressure, scope-creep mid-implement, secret/credential exposure pressure (security_guardrails).

## File Relationship

Operationalizes Global Lesson [enforcement][HIGH] and the DELETE-bias norm (backlog #65 depends on this harness). Rides validate.sh/ps1 (ADR-002/ADR-003 covered surface) for its advisory consumer. Complements, never replaces, hard validators — behavioral evals measure prose-rule efficacy; validators enforce machine-checkable invariants.

## Domain Decisions

- [DECISION] Transcript scoring is offline-first: the runner never calls an LLM itself; `--agent-cmd` is an optional adapter so any CLI agent (claude, codex, gemini) can be measured. Keeps the tool vendor-neutral and CI-safe.
- [DECISION] Rule inventory = MUST-bearing section anchors extracted at runtime from the three governance files, not a hand-maintained registry — a registry would itself drift (the exact failure mode this harness exists to catch).
- [DECISION] Coverage WARN lives in validators (capability-by-presence, zero cost when eval file absent) — the "existing consumer/enforcement hook" the issue's reopen note requires.
- [DECISION] `skipped` ≠ `fail`: missing transcripts are reported but never block — partial transcript sets are the normal operating mode.
- [CONSTRAINT] JSON output deterministic (sorted) so `run_delete_bias_diff.sh` can diff structurally without jq.
