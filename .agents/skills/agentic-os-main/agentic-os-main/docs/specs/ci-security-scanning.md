# Spec: CI Security Scanning

Backlog item #20 — P1, security/ci.

## Goal

Add automated security scanning to GitHub Actions CI so every PR to `main` is checked for code-level vulnerabilities (SAST), leaked credentials (secret detection), and known-CVE dependencies. The security jobs run on every PR and push to `main` and are visible in the PR checks panel, but they are **not required merge checks** unless branch protection is explicitly configured to require them (see `docs/INSTALL.md §Turn on the CI floor`). The three required merge checks for this repo are `Framework Validation`, `ShellCheck`, and `Check Markdown Links`.

## Acceptance Criteria

- **AC-1** — A workflow file exists at `.github/workflows/security.yml` and is triggered on `pull_request` targeting `main` (and on `push` to `main`).
- **AC-2** — The workflow contains a `semgrep` job that runs Semgrep with `--config auto --error` (language-agnostic; auto-detects languages present in the repo). The job exits non-zero on any finding. Note: `--metrics=off` is NOT used — Semgrep 1.123.0+ rejects `--config auto` when metrics are disabled (`Cannot create auto config when metrics are off`); Semgrep telemetry is aggregate stats only (file counts, rule counts — no repo content), so omitting `--metrics=off` still satisfies the no-repo-content constraint.
- **AC-3** — The workflow contains a `trufflehog` job that checks out full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) and scans with `--only-verified`, which suppresses *unverified* matches. **Qualified 2026-08-12 (#171): this bounds unverified noise; it does NOT guarantee a reported finding is real.** A detector whose verifier returns a false positive still fails the job — observed on PR #402, where an ordinary snake_case test identifier was reported as a VERIFIED Lob credential. The job exits non-zero on any verified finding. **Scope (corrected 2026-08-12, #166):** the scan covers the push/PR range only — the composite step invokes `--since-commit <base> --branch <head>`. `fetch-depth: 0` exists so that base commit is resolvable, not to widen the scan, and `test_ac3_checkout_full_depth` asserts only the fetch depth. Consequence worth keeping in view: **a credential introduced before the scanned range is not re-detected by CI.** Correction history in `docs/architecture/ci-security.log.md`.
- **AC-4** — The workflow contains a `dependency-audit` job that runs `pip-audit` (OSV-backed). The run step detects Python dependency files at runtime (after checkout): `requirements*.txt` files are passed via `-r`; a `pyproject.toml` with `[project]` or `[build-system]` is audited via `pip-audit .`; if neither is present, the step exits 0 (skip). The job exits non-zero on any finding (`--strict`; pip-audit has no native severity filter — more conservative than HIGH/CRITICAL minimum and acceptable). Note: job-level `if: hashFiles(...)` is NOT used — it evaluates before checkout and always returns empty on GitHub-hosted runners.
- **AC-5** — All three scanner versions are pinned — not `@main`, `@latest`, or an unversioned branch ref. Semgrep via `pip install semgrep==X.Y.Z`; TruffleHog via GitHub Action **commit SHA** (40 hex chars) with a human-readable version comment (e.g., `@abc123...  # vX.Y.Z`) — semver tags are mutable and do not provide supply-chain immutability, so **all GitHub Actions — including first-party `actions/*` (e.g., `actions/checkout`, `actions/setup-python`) — MUST be pinned to a full 40-hex commit SHA** with a human-readable `# vX.Y.Z` version comment; pip-audit via `pip install pip-audit==X.Y.Z`. Dependabot (`github-actions` ecosystem) MUST be configured to auto-bump these SHA pins, keeping the version comment in sync. **TruffleHog additionally requires a scanner-image pin (added 2026-08-12, backlog #166):** the action SHA binds only the *wrapper*, whose composite step runs `docker run <image>:${VERSION}` with `version` defaulting to `latest` — so a SHA-pinned wrapper still pulled a mutable image, and a pre-bump `main` run (`31288803917` @ `44b2e33`) executed scanner **3.96.0** while the pin read **v3.95.8**. **Revised 2026-08-12 after independent review:** an exact release *tag* is not sufficient either — a tag is mutable by design and can be re-pointed, which is the same objection this AC already makes against semver action refs. The step MUST therefore compose a **digest** reference: `image` ends in `@sha256` and `version` carries the 64-hex manifest digest, so the wrapper's `"${IMAGE}:${VERSION}"` join yields `…/trufflehog@sha256:<64 hex>`. `test_ac5_trufflehog_scanner_pinned_by_digest` reproduces that join and requires the result to match a digest form — an assertion about **immutability by construction**, not agreement between two editable strings. The earlier design (exact tag + an equality test against the `# vX.Y.Z` comment) is withdrawn: review demonstrated by mutation that a hand edit could swap the wrapper SHA while leaving comment and input untouched and the suite stayed green, so the comment is display metadata, not provenance. A release comment beside the digest is still REQUIRED, but only so a reader can map the opaque digest to a version.
- **AC-6** — The workflow declares `permissions: contents: read` at the top level (minimal permissions).
- **AC-7** — No security job uses `continue-on-error: true` (silent failures prohibited).
- **AC-8** — The `validate.sh` and `validate.ps1` scripts gain a security workflow presence check: PASS if `.github/workflows/security.yml` exists; WARN if `.github/workflows/` exists but `security.yml` is absent (non-blocking); SKIP (no output, no counter impact) if `.github/workflows/` directory does not exist (non-Actions repos).
- **AC-9** — Running the updated `validate.sh` / `validate.ps1` against this repo produces 0 FAIL after the workflow file is added.
- **AC-10** — The security workflow is isolated in its own file (`security.yml`). The framework validation workflow (`validate.yml`) gains an additive `test-ci-structural` job to execute structural tests (AC-10 evidence); no existing validate jobs are modified or removed.
- **AC-11** — A `.semgrepignore` file exists at repo root and excludes `tests/`, `.agentcortex/templates/`, and `installers/`. These directories contain intentional bad-pattern examples and eval/curl installer patterns that would cause false positives under `--config auto --error`. The structural test suite asserts both file existence and required exclusions so accidental deletion is caught by CI rather than silently passing with zero coverage.

## Non-goals

- DAST / fuzzing / runtime testing — no running server exists.
- License compliance scanning.
- Container image scanning — no Docker in this repo.
- SBOM generation.
- GitHub Advanced Security code-scanning alert integration (no org-level GitHub Advanced Security license assumed).
- npm / yarn dependency audit — no `package.json` in this repo.
- Full-history TruffleHog scan. *(This slot previously listed the PR-delta scan as a non-goal on the grounds that full-history was already in use — the reverse of the truth. The delta scan is the shipped behaviour; widening it is un-attempted and un-costed. History in the L2 log.)*

## Accepted Risks

- **Scanner detector-freshness lag, newly incurred 2026-08-12 (#166)**: pinning the scanner image by digest means new detectors arrive only when a human updates the pin. **This is a new cost, not one AC-5 had already paid** — before this change the wrapper resolved `latest` at run time and picked up detector releases automatically, so an earlier framing of it as "the trade AC-5 already claimed to have made" conflated stated pinning intent with deployed behaviour and is withdrawn. Dependabot cannot close the gap: it updates action refs, not container image references. Owner: repository maintainer. Cadence: review the pin whenever Dependabot bumps the wrapper SHA (the release comment beside it changes, which is the visible trigger), and at minimum each release cut. Emergency path: if a detector fix is needed before a scheduled sync, set the image/version pair back to a tag temporarily and open a follow-up to restore the digest — a deliberate, reviewable regression rather than a silent one.

- **Semgrep registry outage → silent pass**: `--config auto` downloads rules from `semgrep.dev` at runtime. If the registry is unreachable, Semgrep may load zero rules and exit 0 with no findings — the SAST gate passes with zero coverage. Mitigation: weekly scheduled scan on `main` surfaces outage-driven false-negatives independent of PR cadence. Re-evaluate if this repo moves to a stricter security tier.
- **TruffleHog `--only-verified` false-positive direction (added 2026-08-12, #171)**: precision is not guaranteed either. A detector's verifier can return VERIFIED for a non-credential, which fails the job and blocks the merge; the remedy is per-detector exclusion, tracked in #171, not a change to this flag.
- **TruffleHog `--only-verified` false-negative rate**: Deliberately trades recall for precision. A credential whose verification probe is blocked (network timeout, rate-limit, revoked-but-not-yet-cleaned-up key) reports as "unverified" and the job passes. Accepted: `--only-verified` is required per AC-3 to bound false positives; the alternative (no `--only-verified`) produces signal-to-noise too low to act on.
- **Dependency audit skips repos without auditable Python manifests**: AC-4 gates on `requirements*.txt` at repo root, `.github/requirements-ci.txt`, or `pyproject.toml` with `[project]`/`[build-system]`. Poetry-only projects, `setup.py`-only projects, and repos with only other subdirectory requirements files are not audited. This repo's `.github/requirements-ci.txt` (pinned CI test deps) is now scanned; the job will fail-closed if a CVE is found in those pins. Re-evaluate if additional Python manifests are introduced.
- **Semgrep rule non-determinism**: `--config auto` rules update independently of the pinned `semgrep==X.Y.Z` version. The same commit can produce different findings on different dates. Accepted for now; pinning a specific offline ruleset is a follow-up if rule-drift causes repeated false-positive noise.

## Constraints

- Must run on `ubuntu-latest` GitHub-hosted runners (no self-hosted runners).
- Target additional CI wall-time: ≤ 3 minutes per PR (all three jobs can run in parallel).
- Must require no external API keys or paid-tier accounts — community/open-source tiers only.
- Semgrep must not phone home with repo contents. `--metrics=off` is NOT used (incompatible with `--config auto` in Semgrep 1.123.0+); Semgrep telemetry transmits only aggregate stats, never file contents — constraint is satisfied without the flag.
- All tool installs must use official distribution channels (official GitHub Actions or `pip install`) — no vendored binaries committed to the repo. Semgrep via `pip install` (Docker Hub tags use two-part semver `1.x`, not three-part `1.x.y` — makes pinning unreliable); TruffleHog via official GitHub Action.

## File Relationship

INDEPENDENT — no existing spec covers CI pipeline security. Does not extend or replace any existing `docs/specs/*.md`.

Target files:
- **New**: `.github/workflows/security.yml`
- **New**: `.github/dependabot.yml` (AC-5 Dependabot auto-bump)
- **New**: `tests/ci/test_security_workflow.py` (AC-10 structural tests)
- **New**: `.semgrepignore` (Semgrep scan scope — excludes test fixtures and installer scripts)
- **Modified**: `.agentcortex/bin/validate.sh` (AC-8 check)
- **Modified**: `.agentcortex/bin/validate.ps1` (AC-8 check)
- **Modified**: `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (AC-10 additive `test-ci-structural` job)

## Clarifications Resolved

None — scope was unambiguous from backlog item description.

## Domain Decisions

- [DECISION] Semgrep chosen for SAST over CodeQL and Bandit: language-agnostic (covers both Python and bash), fast (< 60 s on this repo), free community tier requires no API key or paid account, maintained official GitHub Action available. Note: `--config auto` fetches rulesets from `semgrep.dev` registry at runtime — no key is required but outbound network access to `semgrep.dev` is needed; see Accepted Risks for registry-outage behavior.
- [DECISION] TruffleHog chosen for secret detection over git-secrets and gitleaks: broader regex coverage for modern secret formats (cloud provider keys, API tokens), verified-findings mode reduces false positives, has a maintained official GitHub Action.
- [DECISION] `pip-audit` chosen for dependency audit over `safety` and `snyk`: queries OSV directly without requiring a paid API key, integrates cleanly with `pip`, exit-code semantics are well-defined per severity.
- [DECISION] TruffleHog scans the push/PR range (`--since-commit <base> --branch <head>`) with `--only-verified`, and Semgrep installs via pip rather than a container image because Docker Hub tags are two-part semver while pip allows exact three-part pinning. *(A prior version of this entry claimed a full-history scan that catches pre-existing leaks. That was false when written and generated AC-3's matching error. The superseded wording and the reason it survived review are recorded in `docs/architecture/ci-security.log.md`; it is not reproduced here, because struck-through text in a live spec still reads as live text to grep and to any agent loading the file.)*
- [DECISION] (2026-08-12, backlog #166) TruffleHog pins the **scanner image** via `version: "X.Y.Z"`, kept equal to the `uses:` line's `# vX.Y.Z` comment by a test rather than by convention. **Superseded 2026-08-12 by independent review — the digest option below was ADOPTED, not rejected.** The original reasoning ran: (a) *pin by image digest* — strictly more immutable, but unreadable at review time and it decouples from the version comment that Dependabot maintains, so drift becomes harder to notice rather than easier. That weighed readability against immutability and picked the wrong one: review showed the tag remained mutable and that the comment-equality guard proved only that two editable strings agreed, surviving a mutation that swapped the wrapper SHA. Readability is now served by a release comment beside the digest, and binding is served by the digest itself. Still rejected: (b) *leave `latest` and document it* — that is the honour-system-theatre pattern this repo has ruled against, and AC-5's own text already promises the scanner version is pinned; (c) *teach Dependabot to bump the input* — no supported mechanism for a `with:` value. The accepted design deliberately converts a silent unpin into a red test: a Dependabot bump moves the SHA and comment, the equality assertion fails, and a human syncs the input. Tradeoff accepted and recorded: the scanner no longer picks up new detectors automatically between bumps — detector freshness is traded for supply-chain immutability, which is the trade AC-5 already claimed to have made.
- [DECISION] Separate `security.yml` workflow file over adding jobs to `validate.yml`: keeps framework integrity checks and security scans independently retry-able; validate.yml failures don't block security job reruns and vice versa.
- [CONSTRAINT] All scanner action versions MUST be pinned to a specific tag or commit SHA — not floating refs — to prevent supply-chain attacks on the CI pipeline itself.
- [TRADEOFF] Semgrep `--config auto` (language-agnostic) over hardcoded `p/python + p/bash`: auto-detection avoids baking in language assumptions. Community-tier only — no Pro rulesets, no API key required.
- [DECISION] (2026-07-01, PR #306 follow-up) First-party `actions/*` pins tightened from major-version tags to full commit SHA. AC-5 originally permitted first-party tags; the shipped `security.yml`/`validate.yml` and `test_ac5_security_and_validate_actions_use_commit_sha` now require a 40-hex SHA for ALL actions. Rejected the alternative (relax the test to re-allow `@v6`): SHA-pinning the framework's own CI is the stronger supply-chain posture and the churn is contained — Dependabot (`github-actions`) auto-bumps the pins, and `.github/workflows/*` are not deployed to forks, so adopters incur no bump-churn. Stays within the line-82 pinning `[CONSTRAINT]`; no new ADR.
