"""Guards for the absent-tool signal in validate.sh / validate.ps1.

Background: the deployed validators referenced tools that `deploy.sh` does not ship.
Three checks printed a bare ``-- tool not present``, a string that cannot distinguish a
deliberately source-only tool from a broken install, and the top-line summary reported an
unqualified pass regardless (backlog #173, and the same class as #149 / #334).

The fix carries the reason at the CALL SITE -- ``run_python_check_source_only`` in bash,
``-AbsentReason`` in PowerShell -- and counts only absences with NO stated reason, so
"unexpected" is defined by a missing reason rather than by membership in a registry that
can go stale.

These tests are static (no deploy, no subprocess) and exist because the CI
``deploy-smoke-test`` grep is narrower than it looks: it only sees checks invoked through
``run_python_check`` WITHOUT a native presence guard, so it cannot catch a false
source-only claim, and it cannot see presence-guarded checks at all.
