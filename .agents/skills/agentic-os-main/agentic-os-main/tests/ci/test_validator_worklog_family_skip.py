"""Backlog #149: the active work-log check family must announce its own absence.

Eighteen checks in both validators are each guarded by `worklog_count -gt 0` /
`$worklogs.Count -gt 0`. With no active work log every one of them emitted
NOTHING — not a SKIP line, absent from the run — while the summary still printed
"integrity check passed". Measured on one commit 2026-07-27: `pass=99 warn=3`
with no logs, `pass=117 warn=3` with one. A fresh clone or a downstream install
therefore ran ~18 fewer governance checks and was told everything passed.

`.agentcortex/context/work/` ships only a dotfile placeholder (`.gitkeep.md`),
which the `*.md` glob does not match, so "no active logs" is the DEFAULT state of
every new install — not an edge case.

These tests pin the family-level SKIP that closes it. The native emission is
recorded in tests/ci/validator_native_baseline.json under the ADR-006 escape
hatch (the run_python_check / Invoke-PythonCheck wrappers map exit!=0 -> FAIL and
cannot express SKIP).
