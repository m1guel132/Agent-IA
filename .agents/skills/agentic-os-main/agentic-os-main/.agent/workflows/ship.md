> Canonical gate: `Ref: .agent/rules/state_machine.md`

## Gate Engine (Turn 1 — Antigravity Hard Path)

**Phase Verification** (per bootstrap §2b): Read `Current Phase` from Work Log header. Verify transition to `ship` is legal. If illegal, STOP. Otherwise update `Current Phase: ship`. If a new commit was created since the last `Checkpoint SHA`, SHOULD refresh it.

Before ANY ship action, output the Minimal Gate Block:

```yaml
gate: ship
classification: <from Work Log>
branch: <current branch>
checks:
  worklog_exists: yes|no
  spec_exists: yes|no|na
  state_ok: yes|no
  handoff_ok: yes|no|na
verdict: pass|fail
missing: []
```

- If `verdict: fail` → output ONLY the gate block. STOP.
- **Gate Receipt**: After outputting the gate block, append a compact gate receipt to the Work Log under `## Gate Evidence`:
  ```
  - Gate: ship | Verdict: <PASS|FAIL> | Classification: <tier> | Timestamp: <ISO>
  ```
- Resolve the active Work Log path for the current `<worklog-key>` before evaluating `worklog_exists`.
- If no active Work Log exists but archive context for the branch exists, create a follow-up active log, warn the user, and continue gate evaluation. Missing handoff references or missing evidence still require `verdict: fail`.
- If classification is `feature` or `architecture-change`:
  - If the user explicitly requested shipping, proceed directly after gate pass.
  - Only ask for an extra confirmation if ship entry was inferred rather than explicitly requested, or if a separate high-impact choice appears inside `/ship` (for example, concurrent-state merge risk or knowledge-consolidation diff preview).
- `quick-win` / `hotfix`: proceed directly after gate pass.

## Work Log Compaction Check

Before ship evaluation, check the active Work Log size. If it exceeds compaction thresholds (see `.agent/config.yaml` §worklog), compact per `/handoff` §6 BEFORE proceeding. Ship with a bloated log risks archiving an unnecessarily large file.

## Pre-flight Advisory Checks

Run these BEFORE evaluating Ship Checklist. Both are ADVISORY — warn, do not hard-block.

### Rollback Plan Check (feature / architecture-change only)

Scan Work Log `## Known Risk` for "rollback"/"revert"; if absent, output `"⚠️ No rollback plan found in ## Known Risk. Add at least one line describing rollback/revert strategy before shipping."` and record the warning there if the section is otherwise empty.

### Gate Receipt Audit (/ship only)

Scan Work Log `## Gate Evidence` for receipts from required prior phases:
- `feature` / `architecture-change`: bootstrap, plan, implement, review, test, handoff receipts required
- `quick-win`: bootstrap, plan, implement receipts required
- `hotfix`: bootstrap, plan, implement, review, test receipts required (plan is mandatory per §10.2)

**Direct-file-access platforms** (Work Log readable): a missing required receipt for `feature`/`architecture-change` is a hard **`verdict: fail`** (also enforced by `validate.sh`). Output: `"FAIL: Missing required gate receipt for: [phase]."`
**No-file-access platforms** (Codex Web, API-only): **reduced-assurance mode** — paste the `## Gate Evidence` section into chat for manual verification. Output: `"[reduced assurance] Gate receipt for [phase] not verified from file."`
`quick-win`/`hotfix`: a missing required receipt is also a hard **`verdict: fail`** — both validators count it in the FAIL-tier gate-progression counter against the sets above. The fast-paths omit `/handoff`, not receipts.

### Confidence Trace Audit (/ship only)

Scan Work Log `## Phase Summary` + the plan block for `Confidence:`. If `<80%` with no clarification/assumption in `## Known Risk`, output: `"⚠️ Plan confidence was <80% with no recorded clarification. Verify before shipping."` Advisory — warns, never hard-blocks (`engineering_guardrails.md` §4.1).

## Ship Checklist (mandatory — skip = ship fail)

- [ ] Evidence recorded in Work Log `## Evidence` section (non-empty; bootstrap placeholder `"Pending: bootstrap only"` is NOT sufficient — Ref: `engineering_guardrails.md §5.2b`). Changes touching deploy/validator output/README: add a `Demonstration:` line with recipe command + captured output (CI anchor: `test_deploy_manifest_snapshot`).
- [ ] `current_state.md` updated
- [ ] Active Work Log archived to `.agentcortex/context/archive/`
- [ ] Spec-Test trace verified (feature / architecture-change only — see §Spec-Test Traceability below)
- [ ] Domain Doc updated or skip justified (feature / architecture-change only — see §Knowledge Consolidation below)
- [ ] Observability Readiness verified (feature / architecture-change only — see §Observability Readiness below)

## Quick-win / Hotfix Knowledge Nudge (advisory)

**Scope**: `quick-win` / `hotfix` only. Infer `<affected module>`/`<domain>` from (a) Work Log Task Description keywords, then (b) top-level changed-file paths (`src/auth/*` → `auth`); if unclear, ask the user which domain (list existing `docs/architecture/*.log.md` names, or `new:<name>`) — never guess silently.

After evidence is recorded, prompt once per ship (not re-prompted on retry): *"Did this fix change how `<affected module>` works in a non-obvious way? If yes, consider one timestamped line in `docs/architecture/<domain>.log.md` — no spec required."* On yes: append a minimal L2 entry (date, branch, 1-line decision/constraint); if the file is missing, create it only on explicit (yes/no) confirmation. On no: skip silently. Never a gate — it only surfaces the option.

## Observability Readiness Check (feature / architecture-change only)

**Scope**: This check applies ONLY to `feature` and `architecture-change` classifications. `tiny-fix`, `quick-win`, and `hotfix` are exempt.

Before ship, verify the delivered code meets production observability requirements:

1. **Error boundary defined**: all error-handling paths use a production-observable logger (per §5.2a). No debug-only logging as sole error path.
2. **Log sink documented**: Work Log records where errors are reported (e.g., "Sentry via `Logger.error()`", "stdout → CloudWatch", or "Crashlytics via `FirebaseCrashlytics.recordError()`"). If the project has no production logging infrastructure yet, document that as a Known Risk.
3. **Rollback telemetry**: rollback plan (per §12.5) includes how operators will know the rollback succeeded (e.g., error rate returns to baseline, health check passes).

This is an advisory check — missing observability readiness produces a warning, not a hard fail. The warning MUST be recorded in the Work Log under `## Known Risk`.

## Spec-Test Traceability Check (feature / architecture-change only)

**Scope**: This check applies ONLY to `feature` and `architecture-change` classifications. `tiny-fix`, `quick-win`, and `hotfix` are exempt.

Before ship, verify that every Acceptance Criterion in the referenced spec has at least one linked test or an explicitly justified exception:

1. Read the spec's AC section. Each AC SHOULD have a stable identifier (e.g., `AC-1`, `AC-2`).
2. Check test files for `spec_ref:` frontmatter or inline comments linking to the spec.
3. Build coverage map: AC → test(s). If any AC has no linked test, output: `"⚠️ AC [id] has no linked test. Justify or add test before ship."`.
4. An AC may be explicitly exempted with justification recorded in the Work Log (e.g., "AC-3: visual-only change, verified by screenshot evidence").

This is an advisory check in this batch — missing trace produces a warning, not a hard fail. Future batches may escalate to hard gate.

## Skill-Aware Ship Checks (Auto-Enforced)

Before evaluating entry conditions, apply the Phase-Entry Skill-Loading Protocol (shared-contracts.md §Phase-Entry Skill Loading). Read `Recommended Skills` from the active Work Log before selecting which skill guidance to apply in this phase. Then enforce:

**IF `verification-before-completion` is active (MANDATORY for non-tiny-fix):**
Apply the Verification-Before-Completion 5-Gate Contract (shared-contracts.md §Verification Before Completion (5-Gate Sequence)). If ANY gate fails → `verdict: fail`. Do NOT proceed to Entry Conditions.
Phase-specific: Evidence = specific commands, outputs, versions; Communication Gate = include constraints that remain.

**Pre-merge / pre-PR closure (always applies before /ship):**
1. Re-sync with mainline: `git fetch origin && git merge origin/<main-branch>` (use repo's default branch) — verify no conflicts or behavioral drift
2. Re-run minimal required tests + critical regression tests after sync
3. Verify documentation, migration scripts, configuration changes are all committed
4. Select closure option and state it explicitly:
   - **Merge now**: Verification complete, risks acceptable
   - **Open PR**: Requires reviewer or cross-team sync
   - **Keep branch**: Has remaining work; keep active
   - **Archive/Close**: Requirement canceled or strategy changed
Entering "Merge now" is PROHIBITED if evidence is insufficient.

**Production observability check (always applies for feature / architecture-change):**
- Audit every `catch` / error-handling block in changed files: Logger MUST be production-observable (`Logger.error()`, crash reporter, structured stdout) — NOT debug-only (`debugPrint`, `console.log`, `print`).
- Document the error sink in Work Log `## Observability` (e.g., `Sentry via Logger.error()` / `Crashlytics` / `stdout → CloudWatch`). If no production logging infrastructure exists, log this as Known Risk.
- Rollback plan MUST answer: how operators detect the rollback is needed AND that it succeeded (alert / dashboard / health check).
- Full body: `.agents/skills/production-readiness/SKILL.md`.

## Entry Conditions (HARD)

1. Current state is `TESTED`. Exception: `quick-win` MAY ship from `IMPLEMENTING` when inline evidence is present (fast-path per `state_machine.md`). `hotfix` MUST reach `TESTED` first — it is NOT eligible for the implement fast-path.
2. `feature` and `architecture-change` MUST have completed `/handoff`. `quick-win` and `hotfix` are exempt from `/handoff` (per engineering_guardrails.md §10.4).
3. When `/handoff` is required, references MUST meet minimums (doc + code + work log).
4. **Security Gate**: No unresolved CRITICAL/HIGH security findings in Work Log (per `.agent/rules/security_guardrails.md` §6). If found, `verdict: fail`, `missing: ["security: N unresolved CRITICAL/HIGH findings"]`.

If ANY condition fails, MUST reject `/ship` and output missing list.

## Output Format

Apply the shared `Phase Output Compression` contract from `shared-contracts.md §Phase Output Compression → /ship`.

**Chat response is the compact block below. Do NOT replay full implementation, review, or test narratives — they are in the Work Log. Do NOT paste the full commit message body when the title line is enough.**

```
Commit: <conventional-commits title>  (Ref: <SHA>)
Changes: <1-line delta summary>
Evidence: Ref: Work Log §Evidence
SSoT: updated | skipped (reason)
Risk: <1-line or "none">
Archive: <path> | <pending>
⚡ ACX
```

Compression rules:
- One line per field. No decorative headers when the whole block is < 10 lines.
- Evidence goes by reference (`Ref: Work Log §Evidence`), never re-pasted in chat.
- Rollback + risks: 1 line each (unresolved only); full detail lives in Work Log `## Known Risk`.
- If the user asks for the full commit body, change summary, or test output, expand. Default is terse.

## Phase Summary Update

After ship gate passes and before archival, append one line to `## Phase Summary` in the Work Log:
```
- ship: [1-line summary — verdict, commit SHA, archive path]
```

## Review Snapshot Routing Check (AC-30)

Before proceeding with ship, check `docs/reviews/` for any review snapshots that contain structured `routing_actions` blocks with `status: pending` targeting files in the current task's `primary_domain`. If found, MUST resolve before ship or record explicit deferral with justification in the Work Log.

## State Update & Archival

1. **Ship Guard (§11.1)**: Before writing, check if `current_state.md` has been modified since this task started. If modified by another session, warn user and request confirmation before merging. Use **additive merge**, never full overwrite.
2. **SSoT Update & Ship History**:
- Update `.agentcortex/context/current_state.md` Spec Index statuses (mutable snapshot) via `.agentcortex/tools/guard_context_write.py`.
- Use the helper as documented in `.agentcortex/docs/guides/guarded-context-writes.md`. In Stage 1, missing guard receipts are a validation warning, not a hard runtime block.
- **No-Python fallback** (all SSoT writes here incl. §8 heartbeat): direct write + Drift Log entry (AGENTS.md §Write Isolation).
- **Spec Index Cap**: on the `check_ssot_caps.py` over-cap WARN, move the oldest `shipped` **index lines** into the single `## Spec Index Archive` section at the bottom of `current_state.md`, keeping cap-many inline (over-folding re-WARNs). Spec bodies stay in `docs/specs/` — moving one makes the entry a phantom and FAILs.
- MUST add the completion record at the **top** of the `## Ship History` section — immediately after the `## Ship History` header, newest-first, matching the established convention (the most recent ship is the first entry; older entries follow below). Use `.agentcortex/tools/guard_context_write.py --mode replace` (snapshot → insert the entry right after the header → write with `--expected-sha`), or a surgical anchored Edit. **Do NOT use `--mode append`**: it is `O_APPEND` (writes at file-end), which drops the entry at the *bottom* — the oldest position — silently breaking newest-first ordering. See `.agentcortex/docs/guides/guarded-context-writes.md`. **Note**: The Work Log `SSoT Sequence` header field is a bootstrap-time snapshot and is NOT incremented at ship — do not attempt to update it.
- Use the format:

  ```markdown
  ### Ship-<branch_name>-<YYYY-MM-DD>
  - Feature shipped: [summary]
  - Tests: Pass
  ```

- NEVER edit, reorder, or delete previous entries in the `## Ship History`.
- If Ship History exceeds 10 entries, archive older entries to `.agentcortex/context/archive/ship-history-YYYY.md` and keep only the latest 10 in `current_state.md`.
- **Relative-link depth hazard**: content copied from `current_state.md` (depth 2) into `archive/` (depth 3) shifts `../` links one level shallow — broken links are CI-caught; M8 also WARNs. **Strip/convert them to plain text or absolute URLs before committing archived content.**
2b. **Decision Disposition** (all tiers except `tiny-fix`; skip if `## Decisions` absent/empty): append one marker per entry — `→ promoted: ADR-<id>` (project-wide impact, new precedent, or reversal → author/amend that ADR + its Index line this ship) / `→ consolidated: L2 <domain>` (the ship L2 entry) / `→ local`. `→ local` is illegal for an entry naming an `ADR-<n>` or reversing a durable decision — use promoted/consolidated. Populate step-3 `decisions[]` with each entry's title. Headless: self-mark; `check_decision_disposition` WARNs on unmarked logs and ADR-naming locals.
3. **Move** (not copy) `.agentcortex/context/work/<worklog-key>.md` to `.agentcortex/context/archive/<worklog-key>-<YYYYMMDD>.md` (the **root** of `archive/`, if task complete) — delete the `work/` original, else the validator WARNs "shipped work logs still in active work/ directory". This is **final archival** of the whole log — distinct from `/handoff §6` compaction, which offloads stale detail of a *still-active* log into the `archive/work/` subdir. The `-<YYYYMMDD>` suffix is required: it prevents a reused branch (e.g. a downstream that does all work on `main`) from overwriting its own prior archive on the next ship. Record the resulting filename in the `INDEX.jsonl` `log` field below.
    - Do NOT duplicate `/retro`-promoted Global Lessons during ship. `/retro` owns structured Global Lesson promotion.
    - **Archive Index Update**: After archiving, append a structured record to `.agentcortex/context/archive/INDEX.jsonl`. The archive index is a hash-chained audit log — every append MUST add `prev_sha` (computed by the helper) so the chain stays intact. Use:
      ```bash
      python .agentcortex/tools/append_chain_entry.py append \
        --path .agentcortex/context/archive/INDEX.jsonl \
        --entry '{"log": "<archived-filename>", "branch": "<branch>", "classification": "<tier>", "modules": ["<file-or-module>"], "specs": ["<spec-ref>"], "patterns": ["<tag>"], "decisions": ["<1-line>"], "shipped": "<YYYY-MM-DD>"}'
      ```
      - The helper reads the previous entry, computes its sha256[:8], and prepends `prev_sha` to the new entry. The first (genesis) entry uses `prev_sha: "GENESIS"`.
      - **Do NOT** include `prev_sha` in the `--entry` JSON yourself; the helper rejects entries that already contain it.
      - **Do NOT** call `guard_context_write.py append` for `INDEX.jsonl` — that path lacks chain awareness and silently breaks the chain. `check_audit_chain.py` catches it upstream **and downstream** — that checker is deployed. The helper is the only correct path.
      - If `INDEX.jsonl` does not exist, the helper creates it. If a legacy `INDEX.md` exists, keep it as a compatibility mirror but prefer `INDEX.jsonl` for new entries.
      - **Python-unavailable fallback**: If `python` is unavailable, **skip the INDEX.jsonl write entirely** — do NOT write a `prev_sha: "GENESIS"` entry, as that breaks the chain for every subsequent append — failing the audit-chain check wherever python is present. Record the skip in Work Log Drift Log: `"INDEX.jsonl update skipped: python unavailable"`. Chain integrity remains intact (the entry is simply absent rather than broken).
4. **Product Backlog Update**: If `docs/specs/_product-backlog.md` exists and this feature is listed:
   - Update feature status: `In Progress` → `Shipped`
   - Update `last_updated` in frontmatter
   - If ALL features are now `Shipped` or `Deferred`/`Cancelled`, output: "🎉 Product backlog complete. All features shipped or resolved."
   - If Pending features remain, output: "Backlog: [N] features remaining. Next session can run `/spec-intake` §8a to continue."
   - Update `current_state.md` **Active Backlog** field to `docs/specs/_product-backlog.md` (if not already set). This is the only mechanism that persists backlog awareness across sessions via SSoT.
5. **Raw Intake Cleanup**: If `docs/specs/_product-backlog.md` exists and ALL features from the current intake are `Shipped` or `Cancelled`, delete any remaining `docs/specs/_raw-intake*.md` files. These are temporary artifacts; the structured specs are now the SSoT. Log deletion in Work Log.
6. Freeze Artifacts: Ensure all produced Specs/ADRs have YAML frontmatter `status: frozen`. If missing, add it before commit.
   - **Skip non-freezable statuses**: Documents with `status: living` (e.g., `_product-backlog.md`) or `status: raw` (e.g., `_raw-intake.md`) MUST NOT be frozen. These are tracking/temporary artifacts, not spec deliverables.
   - **Spec Freshness**: If implementation DIFFERS from any referenced spec's AC, MUST update the spec to match actual behavior before freezing. Append `[Updated: <date>]` to the corresponding Spec Index entry in `current_state.md`.
   - **Shipped Frontmatter** (AC-27): After freezing, set `status: shipped` on all referenced specs that are being completed in this branch. This signals to future `/bootstrap` sessions to prefer Domain Doc L1 over these specs as design authority.

7. **Knowledge Consolidation** (feature / architecture-change only — AC-13–17, AC-32):

   **Capability-by-presence with snapshot accountability**: Read `Primary Domain Snapshot` from the active Work Log first. If the current spec lacks `primary_domain` but the snapshot records a non-`none` value, treat the snapshot as authoritative for ship gating and require an explicit justification for why the field was removed. If both the spec and snapshot are missing/`none`, skip this step entirely.

   **Forward-only rollout** (AC-33): Knowledge consolidation applies only to specs created after the doc-lifecycle-governance feature is shipped. Existing shipped specs (those with `status: shipped` set before this feature) are NOT retroactively consolidated. Do not attempt to consolidate them.

   **Domain Doc Gate** (AC-15): If the current spec or the `Primary Domain Snapshot` indicates `primary_domain` and Domain Doc L2 (`docs/architecture/<primary_domain>.log.md`) was NOT modified in this branch, MUST prompt:
   `"Domain doc not updated. Spec or bootstrap snapshot still points to primary_domain '<domain>'. Summarize or justify skip against that recorded field."` Missing justification = ship gate fail. Generic skip text is invalid; the justification must explicitly explain why consolidation is still unnecessary despite the recorded `primary_domain`, including any reason the field was later removed from the spec. Acceptable examples: `"L1 already covers this incremental change; no new domain decision was introduced."` or `"The domain doc was updated separately in this session and consolidation is therefore already satisfied."`

   **Advisory Lock Check** (AC-17): Before writing L2, check `.agentcortex/context/domain/<domain>.lock.json`. If a non-stale lock exists for another session, warn: `"⚠️ Domain doc lock held by [owner] since [updated_at]. Concurrent write risk. Proceed? (yes/no)"`. This is advisory — it warns but does not hard-block.

   **Consolidation Steps**:
   a. Read `## Domain Decisions` from the referenced spec. If absent, skip (no entries to consolidate).
   b. Build the entry block:
      ```markdown
      ### [<primary_domain>][<YYYY-MM-DD>][<branch-name>]
      source_spec: docs/specs/<feature>.md
      source_sha: <HEAD SHA>

      <copy each [DECISION] / [TRADEOFF] / [CONSTRAINT] entry verbatim>
      ```
   c. **Diff Preview** (AC-16, feature / architecture-change): Show the entry block as a diff preview to the user before writing. Require user confirmation before proceeding (consistent with existing `/ship` confirmation gate).
   d. Append the entry block to `docs/architecture/<primary_domain>.log.md` (L2, append-only — NEVER modify or delete existing entries).
   e. For each `secondary_domain` in the spec's `secondary_domains` list: append a cross-reference pointer only to that domain's L2 — no content duplication:
      ```markdown
      ### [<secondary_domain>][<YYYY-MM-DD>][<branch-name>]
      cross-ref: See [<primary_domain>][<YYYY-MM-DD>][<branch-name>] in docs/architecture/<primary_domain>.log.md
      ```
   f. **Restructure Advisory** (AC-19): Count L2 entries in the `primary_domain` log. If any section has ≥ `domain_doc.restructure_threshold` entries (default: 5 from `.agent/config.yaml`), output advisory: `"Domain doc '<domain>' has N entries. Consider /govern-docs --restructure <domain>."`

8. **SSoT Heartbeat Update** (AC-25): As the final step of State Update & Archival, increment the `Update Sequence` by 1 in `current_state.md` and set `Last Updated` to the current ISO timestamp. This runs after all other ship writes (SSoT, archive, backlog, freeze, knowledge consolidation) are complete. Use guard_context_write.py for this write.

9. **Lock Release**: After archival completes, MUST attempt to release the Work Log lock (the branch is closed; a lingering lock only false-blocks the next session on this key until staleness):

   ```bash
   python .agentcortex/tools/recover_worklog_lock.py release \
     --lock .agentcortex/context/work/<worklog-key>.lock.json \
     --owner "<owner>" --session "<session>"
   ```

   Failure or refusal → WARN only (staleness self-heals); never a gate fail. Skip when Python is unavailable.

## Post-Ship Lifecycle Suggestions (Advisory)

> **Output format**: Single line appended to ship chat block. Emit ONLY triggered items. **Never blocks.**
> **Template**: `Next: /retro · /<other-workflow> (<trigger reason>) — skip all?`

Trigger conditions (check silently; emit only matches):
- Always → `/retro`
- Ship commit touches `docs/specs/` or `docs/architecture/` → `/sync-docs (docs changed)`
- Ship commit touches `.agent/`, `AGENTS.md`, or `.agentcortex/` → `/govern-docs (governance changed)`

Skip → no Drift Log entry required (ship is a terminal phase; retro will surface patterns separately).
