# Routing Index

This file is the **canonical lookup table** for natural-language trigger phrases.
It is consulted at routing time, ambiguity resolution time, or command discovery time.
It does NOT contain governance rules — those remain in `AGENTS.md`.

**Precedence**: `AGENTS.md` > `.agent/workflows/routing.md` > `.agent/skills/`

## 1. Workflow Trigger Map

> **Auto-suggest when** column: Present only in sections where phase-lifecycle or classification context can trigger the workflow without an explicit user phrase. Core Phase Workflows, Spec & Intake, Emergency & Fix, Testing Helpers, and Utility sections do not have this column — they are routed explicitly or through governance gates.

### Core Phase Workflows

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "help me design", "幫我規劃" | `/plan` |
| "ship this", "上線吧" | `/ship` |
| "implement this", "開始寫", "動手做" | `/implement` |
| "review this", "幫我看看", "code review" | `/review` |
| "run tests", "跑測試", "verify" | `/test` |
| "typo", "rename variable" | tiny-fix (execute directly) |
| "I want to add X", "我想加 X", "新增功能 X", "我要實作 X", "加一個 X", "幫我做 X" | `/bootstrap` (single feature) — if multi-feature intent detected, route to `/spec-intake` instead |
| "review failed", "review 沒過", "review 不通過", "fix review findings", "補齊 review" | `/implement` — REVIEWED→IMPLEMENTING reverse transition |
| "tests failed", "test 沒過", "tests are failing", "修測試", "fix test failures" | `/implement` — TESTED→IMPLEMENTING reverse transition |

### Spec & Intake

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "here's my spec", "我有一個spec", "這是產品規格", user pastes a spec doc, user gives a file path to a spec | `/spec-intake` (do NOT jump directly to bootstrap or plan) |
| "next feature", "下一個", "繼續做", "continue with backlog" | `/spec-intake` §8a continuation (read `_product-backlog.md`, skip decomposition) |
| "改 spec", "amend the spec", "spec 要調整" | `/spec-intake` §8b amendment (check spec status, apply timing rules) |
| "先做 #5", "reorder", "defer #3", "不做了" | `/spec-intake` §8c reorder/defer/cancel |
| "這個 P0", "升到優先", "#3 改成 P1", "reprioritize", "priority 改" | `/spec-intake` §8c reprioritize — **tiebreaker**: if phrase contains a P-tier token (P0/P1/P2), prefer reprioritize over reorder |
| "寫規格", "write spec", "convert requirements" | `/spec` |

### Architecture & Setup

| Phrases | Route | Auto-suggest when |
|---|---|---|
| "設定架構", "init app", "define tech stack", "set up project" | `/app-init` (full) | — |
| "加後端", "set up [layer]", "define [layer] conventions", "加 API", "加資料庫" | `/app-init --partial` (mid-development) | — |
| "新增 skill", "add skill for X" | `/app-init` §3 (skill-only generation) | — |
| "architecture decision", "為什麼選這個", "record decision", "ADR" | `/adr` | tech stack selection detected in /plan |

### Emergency & Fix

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "production bug", "緊急修復", "urgent fix", "hotfix" | `/hotfix` |
| "bootstrap", "開始新任務", "start task" | `/bootstrap` |

### Research & Analysis

| Phrases | Route | Auto-suggest when |
|---|---|---|
| "研究一下", "investigate", "explore", "look into this" | `/research` | hotfix classification; uncertainty about root cause in /implement |
| "腦力激盪", "brainstorm", "explore options", "what are our choices" | `/brainstorm` | feature/arch-change with no frozen spec (bootstrap §3.7) |
| "audit this repo", "評估現狀", "map existing code" | `/audit` | first session in a new module, no ADR exists |
| "governance audit", "premortem", "治理自我稽核", "audit the governance", "稽核大腦" | `/govern-audit` | — |

### Completion & Handoff

| Phrases | Route | Auto-suggest when |
|---|---|---|
| "交接", "handoff", "summarize for next session" | `/handoff` | — |
| "記錄決定", "log decision", "why did we choose" | `/decide` | design fork detected in /plan or /implement (see plan.md Pre-Plan Advisory) |
| "回顧", "retrospective", "lessons learned", "retro" | `/retro` | after /ship completes (ship.md lifecycle hook) |

### Documentation

| Phrases | Route | Auto-suggest when |
|---|---|---|
| "同步文件", "sync docs", "docs out of date" | `/sync-docs` | /ship touches docs/specs/ or docs/architecture/ files |
| "更新治理文件", "update governance docs" | `/govern-docs` | /ship release includes .agent/ or AGENTS.md changes |

### Testing & Planning Helpers

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "test blueprint", "測試骨架", "test structure only" | `/test-skeleton` |
| "classify tests", "測試分級" | `/test-classify` |
| "worktree", "parallel branch", "隔離分支" | `/worktree-first` |

### Utility & Help

| Phrases | Route |
|---|---|
| "help", "有什麼指令", "commands" | `/help` |

---

## 2. Optional Module Trigger Map

> **Hard Rule (from AGENTS.md)**: Optional modules are explicit opt-in. The AI MUST NOT silently choose any optional module. Phrases in this section only activate a module when the user **clearly requests** it.

| Phrases | Module | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| "ask openrouter", "用其他模型" | `/ask-openrouter` | requires CLI |
| "run with codex", "用 codex" | `/codex-cli` | requires CLI |
| "run with claude", "用 claude", "用 claude-cli", "implement 交給 claude", "實作交給 claude", "測試交給 claude", "讓 claude 寫", "讓 claude 跑測試" | `/claude-cli` | requires CLI; MUST NOT auto-trigger |
| "use local model", "ask the local model", "用本地模型", "問本地模型", "交給本地模型", "讓本地模型寫" | `/ask-local` | requires reachable OpenAI-compatible endpoint (Ollama / LM Studio / vLLM); MUST NOT auto-trigger |

---

## 3. Skill Activation Trigger Map

> **This table IS the canonical skill index** — it maps every user-facing trigger phrase to a skill ID. For "what skills are available?" questions, this is the answer. Skill bodies live in `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md`; trigger metadata (phases, cost_risk, load_policy) lives in `.agentcortex/metadata/trigger-compact-index.json` when present.
>
> Skills activated via the Intent Router attach to the **current workflow phase only**. They MUST NOT replace, skip, or alter phase order. See AGENTS.md §Skill Safety & Precedence for the full hard rule.

| Phrases | Skill |
|---|---|
| "用 TDD", "test first", "先寫測試", "red green refactor" | `test-driven-development` |
| "API 設計", "endpoint conventions", "REST design" | `api-design` |
| "資料庫設計", "schema design", "migration safety" | `database-design` |
| "前端模式", "component patterns", "UI conventions" | `frontend-patterns` |
| "安全檢查", "auth check", "security review", "權限檢查" | `auth-security` |
| "紅隊測試", "adversarial test", "red team", "攻擊面分析" | `red-team-adversarial` |
| "debug", "除錯", "systematic debugging", "找 bug" | `systematic-debugging` |
| "平行開發", "parallel agents", "dispatch subtasks" | `dispatching-parallel-agents` |
| "subagent", "分派 agent", "multi-agent" | `subagent-driven-development` |
| "完成前檢查", "verify before done", "completion check" | `verification-before-completion` |
| "用 worktree", "git worktree", "worktree 隔離" | `using-git-worktrees` |
| "查文件", "check docs", "查官方文檔", "read the docs", "看文件再做" | `doc-lookup` |
| _(auto; behavioral baseline for all non-trivial coding — plan/implement/review)_ | `karpathy-principles` |
| _(auto; pre-ship observability for `feature`/`architecture-change` — review/ship)_ | `production-readiness` |
| "執行計畫" / "execute the plan" / "完成分支" / "merge 準備" / "請求 review" / "接收 review" / "寫計畫" | inlined into `/plan`, `/implement`, `/handoff`, `/ship`, `/review` workflows — no skill load needed |

### 3a. Framework Skill Namespace & Downstream `custom-*` Reservation (Ref: ADR-005)

The framework owns exactly these **14** skill names (do not reuse them for downstream-custom skills):

`api-design`, `auth-security`, `database-design`, `dispatching-parallel-agents`, `doc-lookup`, `frontend-patterns`, `karpathy-principles`, `production-readiness`, `red-team-adversarial`, `subagent-driven-development`, `systematic-debugging`, `test-driven-development`, `using-git-worktrees`, `verification-before-completion`.

**Reserved downstream namespace** — the framework guarantees it will **never** ship a skill whose name begins with `custom-`. Downstream projects (fork or clone) SHOULD name their own skills `custom-<name>` under `.agents/skills/custom-<name>/` (full body) + `.agent/skills/custom-<name>` (metadata). This guarantees:

- **No collision on upgrade**: an upstream skill can never later claim a `custom-*` name.
- **Preservation on deploy**: `custom-*` skills are net-new to the framework source, so `deploy.sh` never touches them; even a same-named framework skill edit is sidecar-protected, not silently overwritten (Ref: ADR-005, `deploy.sh get_tier` → scaffold for `.agent/skills/*`,`.agents/skills/*`).
- **Additive-fork cleanliness**: because `custom-*` files are disjoint from the framework's file set, `git pull upstream` stays conflict-free for forks that only *add* skills (never edit framework skills in place).

### 3b. Subagent Sentinel Emission (Ref: ADR-007)

The `⚡ ACX` runtime sentinel is **primary-emitted**. A harness-dispatched subagent's output returns **internally to the primary**, not as a user-facing chat turn — so subagents neither emit nor need the sentinel, and a subagent output missing `⚡ ACX` is NOT a violation. The primary (the agent inside the governed phase) is the sole sentinel emitter, exactly as it is the sole Work Log writer and gate owner under `subagent_policy: read-only` (Ref: bootstrap §1b, ADR-007).

## 4. Ambiguity Rules

1. **spec-intake vs bootstrap**: If the user provides a spec document or file path containing multiple features, route to `/spec-intake` — NOT directly to `/bootstrap` or `/plan`. Single-feature input without a spec document may proceed to `/bootstrap`.

2. **Optional module ambiguity**: A phrase like "用 claude" requires clear delegation intent. Ambiguous phrasing (e.g., "can Claude do this?") does NOT trigger `/claude-cli`. Require explicit delegation request before routing to any optional module.

3. **tiny-fix vs quick-win escalation**: Modifying `docs/specs/`, `docs/architecture/`, any file with `status: frozen`, `AGENTS.md`, `.agent/rules/*.md`, `.agent/config.yaml`, `.agentcortex/templates/*`, `.agentcortex/bin/validate.*`, or platform adapter entry files (`CLAUDE.md`, `GEMINI.md`) always escalates to quick-win minimum — even if fewer than 3 files are touched. (Authoritative rule in AGENTS.md §Agentic OS Runtime v1 rule 2.)

4. **Skill vs workflow**: If a user's request matches both a skill phrase (§3) and a workflow route (§1), route to the workflow phase first and activate the skill within that phase. Skills do not replace phase routing.

5. **Skill manual activation block**: Even when a user explicitly requests a skill, the bootstrap rule table's `Skip when` column governs. If the rule table says skip for the current classification, manual activation is blocked.

6. **audit vs govern-audit**: `/audit` maps a legacy/project CODEBASE (onboarding); `/govern-audit` audits the GOVERNANCE SYSTEM itself (gates, validators, wiring). "評估現狀" about the project → `/audit`; about the framework/brain → `/govern-audit`.

7. **Pinned skill vs skip-when precedence**: Pinned skills from user preferences (`.agentcortex/context/private/user-preferences.yaml`) follow the same skip-when rules as manually activated skills UNLESS the pin entry includes `force: true`. Force-pinned skills override skip-when but still respect `phase_scope` boundaries — a skill cannot activate in a phase it was never designed for. This is the ONLY mechanism that can override skip-when; manual activation (rule 5) cannot. See bootstrap §3.6a.

## 5. Command Discovery Notes

All commands are dispatched per `AGENTS.md §Agentic OS Runtime v1` and execute canonical workflows from `.agent/workflows/<command>.md`. For the Claude platform, dispatcher stubs live in `.claude/commands/<command>.md`.

> **Note**: `.agent/workflows/commands.md` is a compatibility alias. This routing index is the canonical source for command discovery.
