# Canonical Development State Machine

## Defined States

`INIT` -> `BOOTSTRAPPED` -> `CLASSIFIED` -> [`SPECIFIED`] -> `PLANNED` -> `IMPLEMENTABLE` -> `IMPLEMENTING` -> `REVIEWED` -> `TESTED` -> [`HANDEDOFF`] -> `SHIPPED`

(`HANDEDOFF` is required for `feature` / `architecture-change`; skipped for `quick-win` / `hotfix`.)

## Allowed Transitions

AI MUST self-enforce this phase order. Users may trigger transitions via slash commands (as shortcuts) OR via natural language — AI determines the appropriate phase regardless of wording.

- `INIT` --(external spec provided)--> `INIT` [runs `/spec-intake`; produces frozen spec + optional `_product-backlog.md`; loops back to INIT until spec is frozen]
- `INIT` --(context loaded)--> `BOOTSTRAPPED` [if frozen external spec exists, bootstrap reads it directly — Bootstrap Lite path]
- `BOOTSTRAPPED` --(task classified)--> `CLASSIFIED`  [Sets: Guardrails Mode (Full|Quick|Lite), Context Budget tier]
- `CLASSIFIED` --(research / brainstorm iteration)--> `CLASSIFIED`
- `CLASSIFIED` --(spec artifact created in `docs/specs/`)--> `SPECIFIED`
- `SPECIFIED` --(plan produced)--> `PLANNED`
- `CLASSIFIED` --(plan produced)--> `PLANNED`  [ONLY for: `tiny-fix`, `quick-win`, `hotfix`]
- `PLANNED` --(gate pass)--> `IMPLEMENTABLE`
- `IMPLEMENTABLE` --(begin implementation)--> `IMPLEMENTING`
- `IMPLEMENTING` --(review pass)--> `REVIEWED`
- `REVIEWED` --(test pass)--> `TESTED`
- `TESTED` --(handoff executed, `feature`/`architecture-change` only)--> `HANDEDOFF`  [Writes `Current Phase: handoff` and gate receipt. Required before SHIPPED for these tiers.]
- `HANDEDOFF` --(ship executed)--> `SHIPPED`
- `TESTED` --(ship executed, `quick-win`/`hotfix` only)--> `SHIPPED`  [fast-path: handoff exempt for these tiers]
- `IMPLEMENTING` --(evidence provided, `quick-win` only)--> `SHIPPED`  [fast-path: skip REVIEWED/TESTED/HANDEDOFF; `quick-win` only — `hotfix` MUST go through REVIEWED + TESTED]
- `REVIEWED` --(defects found; code change required)--> `IMPLEMENTING`  [Reverse: "Not Ready" verdict. Record reason in Work Log `## Drift Log`; update `Current Phase: implement`.]
- `TESTED` --(tests red; code change required)--> `IMPLEMENTING`  [Reverse: test suite stays red after debugging. Record reason in `## Drift Log`; update `Current Phase: implement`.]
- `HANDEDOFF` --(ship Entry Condition fail; code change required)--> `IMPLEMENTING`  [Reverse: e.g. unresolved CRITICAL security finding at ship gate. Record reason in `## Drift Log`; re-run review → test → handoff to re-enter HANDEDOFF before ship.]
- `IMPLEMENTING` --(scope creep detected; reclassification required)--> `CLASSIFIED`  [Reverse transition for Mid-Execution Guard. Required actions BEFORE this transition: (a) `git stash` any uncommitted code; (b) record the original classification + rollback reason in Work Log `## Drift Log`; (c) clear `Frozen: true` and set `Classification: CLASSIFIED` in Work Log header; (d) re-enter `/bootstrap §0–§3` to re-classify at the higher tier; (e) re-run all gates from the new classification's required path. NOT a free downgrade — pure re-traversal. See `.agent/workflows/implement.md §Mid-Execution Guard`.]
- `IMPLEMENTABLE` --(scope creep detected pre-implementation)--> `CLASSIFIED`  [Same as above but no stash needed; just re-bootstrap.]

## Spec Gate (Hard)

- Classifications `feature` and `architecture-change` MUST reach `SPECIFIED` before planning.
- `SPECIFIED` requires a corresponding `docs/specs/<feature>.md` artifact with `status: draft` or `status: frozen`.
- `tiny-fix`, `quick-win`, and `hotfix` may transition directly from `CLASSIFIED` to `PLANNED`.

## Read-Only Actions (No State Change)

- Listing help, available commands, generating test skeletons

## Classification Escalation Rules

These rules override the initial classification. AI MUST apply them during `/bootstrap` and re-check during `/implement` Mid-Execution Guard.

- **Auth Escalation**: If a `quick-win` touches authentication, authorization, session management, or token handling → escalate to `hotfix` minimum. Hotfix requires REVIEWED + TESTED gates.
- **Supply-Chain / Provenance Escalation**: If a `quick-win` touches installer/updater/bootstrap implementation logic for source selection/provenance (`source_repo`, `--source`, cache origin verification, manifest integrity, remote fetch/download/clone/pull/checkout, or executing framework code from a resolved source) → escalate to `hotfix` minimum. Hotfix requires REVIEWED + TESTED gates because the change crosses a downstream trust boundary. Docs-only exempt.
- **Governance File Escalation**: If a `tiny-fix` modifies `.agent/rules/*`, `.agent/config.yaml`, or `AGENTS.md` (and the other tiny-fix-excluded surfaces — full canonical list: `engineering_guardrails.md §10.3`) → escalate to `quick-win` minimum.
- **Scope Escalation**: If actual changes exceed classification threshold (e.g., `quick-win` touching >2 modules) → reverse-transition `IMPLEMENTING → CLASSIFIED` (or `IMPLEMENTABLE → CLASSIFIED`) per the explicit transitions above. **Hard-block thresholds**: user "no" answer to escalation prompt is NOT acceptable when ANY of these are true: actual diff > 200 lines OR > 2 modules touched OR new directory added. In those cases the reverse transition is MANDATORY; the only choice the user gets is which higher tier to escalate to.

## Hard Gates

- `feature` and `architecture-change` MUST complete a handoff phase before `SHIPPED`. Required references:
  1. ✅ `.agentcortex/` artifact path
  2. ✅ modified code path
  3. Resolved active work log path (`.agentcortex/context/work/<worklog-key>.md`)
- `quick-win` and `hotfix` are exempt from `/handoff` but MUST provide evidence (diff + behavior verification) and MUST keep a Work Log whose `## Gate Evidence` carries the required receipts — `quick-win`: bootstrap, plan, implement; `hotfix`: those plus review, test. A missing receipt is a validator FAIL, not a WARN.
- `tiny-fix` allows fast-path but MUST provide minimal evidence (diff + one-line verification).

## Legacy State Mapping (Migration)

- `SPEC_READY` -> `SPECIFIED`
- `PLAN_READY` -> `IMPLEMENTABLE`
- `IN_PROGRESS` -> `IMPLEMENTING`
- `UNDER_REVIEW` -> `REVIEWED`
- `DONE` -> `SHIPPED` (Requires test & ship gates)
