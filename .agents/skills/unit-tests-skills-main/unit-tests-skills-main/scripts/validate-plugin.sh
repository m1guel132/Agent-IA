# Validates the Claude Code plugin and marketplace manifests.

# Run before pushing any change to .claude-plugin/ or skills/. The
# community-marketplace review pipeline runs `claude plugin validate` on every
# submission, so a failure here is a failure there.

# Usage: ./scripts/validate-plugin.sh
# Requires: claude (npm i -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code), jq
#
# No credentials needed — validation is entirely local.

# of drift that ships a marketplace advertising a version nobody receives.
